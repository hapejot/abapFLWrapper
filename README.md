# abapFLWrapper
Generates a wrapper around ABAP function libraries


# Background

I started this little project as my own 'real world' project to test TDD.
After some inspiration of the openSAP course [Writing Testable Code for ABAP](https://open.sap.com/courses/wtc1)

The goal of this project is one one side to provide a means to encapsulate 
existing function libraries and modules into classes and methods together with
interfaces so one can use the test double functionality.
My personal goal is to find my style to do TDD.
